Hey guys! This is the source code of the Tic Tac Toe web based game I built. It has good a profile management interface, a single player mode with a computer opponent, a multiplayer mode with room creation and joining features enabling you to play with your friends. This project is currently not hosted. To test the multiplayer option, connent two devices in the same wifi and you can access the app using the IpAddress:PortNumber. Before starting the app, open a posgres database, create the tables account, userinfo and rooms with the necessary columns, primary keys and foreign keys. Then you're all good to go!!! ENJOY!
